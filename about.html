                    <h3>What about me?</h3>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Freshia Piquero Apad (you can call me Fresh). I’m 19 years old, born on December 20, 2005, and I live in Magdiwang. I’m someone who enjoys learning, connecting with people, and making the most out of every experience. I believe that staying positive and being true to yourself can take you far in life.</p>
                    <p>Parents: Cirila Piquero and Aldo Apad</p>
                    <p>Skills: Adaptability, Socials, Self-Awareness, Attention to Details</p>
                    <p>Goals: One of my biggest goals in life is to help and love animals. I’ve always had a soft spot for them, and I dream of one day being able to support animal welfare—whether through volunteering, rescuing, or simply spreading awareness about their needs.
                        Alongside that, I’m passionate about learning and growing as a person, always aiming to lead with kindness, compassion, and purpose.</p>
